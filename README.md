Emotion-Aware AI Assistant
  An intelligent assistant that listens to your voice, transcribes it to text, detects the underlying emotion, and responds accordingly using       Google Gemini AI. It combines speech recognition, emotion classification, natural language generation to deliver emotionally awareresponses.
  
Features:
	
 	Speech-to-Text Transcription using Whisper by OpenAI
	
	Emotion Detection using:
	
	Pretrained model (j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base)
	
	OR Logistic Regression classifier trained on dair-ai/emotion
	
	Contextual AI Responses generated by Google Gemini
	
	Cleaned and lemmatized text preprocessing using NLTK
	
	Fully automated voice-to-response lo

| `torchaudio` + `sounddevice` | Record and save live voice input                             |
| `transformers` (`Whisper`)   | Convert speech to text                                       |
| `nltk`                       | Text preprocessing (stopwords, lemmatizer)                   |
| `scikit-learn`               | Custom emotion classification (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) |
| `google.generativeai`        | Response generation via Gemini AI                            |
| `huggingface/datasets`       | Load `dair-ai/emotion` dataset                               |


How It Works?
	
 	1.Records a 5-second voice clip from the user.
	
	2.Transcribes the audio using Whisper.
	
	3.Preprocesses the text (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.).
	
	4.Classifies emotion using a fine-tuned model or logistic regression.
	
	5.Sends the emotion context + user message to Gemini AI.
	
	6.Displays a response tailored to the detected emotion.

Example Output:

 	Recording... Speak now!
	Recording finished.
	Transcribed Text: I'm feeling a little lost and sad today.
	Predicted Emotion: sadness
	Response: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. You're not alone, and I'm here for you.
